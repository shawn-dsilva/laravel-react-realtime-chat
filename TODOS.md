# React Laravel Real-Time Chat

## Notes

-   DB_HOST in .env should be the same as the service name in `docker-compose.yml`, by default it is mysql.
-   Ports for both main server and websockets server must be exposed in `docker-compose.yml` else laravel echo client will not connect to the server
-   PHP-FPM Docker container has no `php.ini` by default, rename or copy php.ini-production in `/usr/local/etc/php/`
-   Set authEndpoint to subdirectory+/broadcasting/auth if serving this app through a subfolder.
-   Set BROADCAST_DRIVER in .env to pusher, anything else and realtime chat functionality will not work at all.
-   While serving from subdirectory, `wsHost` must be the same in `config/broadcast.php` and `Echo` object in Javascript
-   overflow-y must be set to hidden in collapse container in ChatDmUserList, else the elements overflow into the divs below
-   Run `php artisan storage:link` after cloning repo
-   Run `php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Laravolt\Avatar\ServiceProvider"`, change driver to gd if imagemagick doesn't work.
-   Run `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y imagemagick php-imagick` to install imagemagick.
-   `MIX_AUTH_ENDPOINT` must have host:port matching what is used for the local or prod server, that is `8000` for docker container

## Log of Fixed Errors

-   Ref Error #1 : The error was occuring due to object `$channelWithDataNew` being returned in response of `acceptInviteRequest()`, with `id` being the channel detail entry's ID and not the ID of the Channel, which was causing 403 Permission denied errors when Laravel Echo tried to authorize at the `/broadcast/auth` route with incorrect channel ID.
    Error solved when correct `$channel` object being returned in response.
-   Ref Error #2 : Same reason as Error #1, id of the details entry being returned instead of the channel's id.
-   Ref Error #3 : Multiple copies of the same message appearing because of not leaving previous channels properly.
